<h3 id="lecturetimesandlocation">LECTURE TIMES AND LOCATION</h3>

<p>Formal meeting times shall be on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 14:30 to 15:45 in 4BC57. In the event of inclement weather, check my Twitter stream (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dtduval">twitter.com/dtduval</a>) for updates <strong>before</strong> coming to class.</p>

<h3 id="thewait-list">THE WAIT-LIST</h3>

<p>Demand can often exceed supply for courses at any University, and unfortunately it is not possible to simply increase capacity in a course without seriously jeopardising the classroom learning environment. Students wishing to register in this course fall into one of four groups. In order of priority with respect to gaining access to the course, the groups are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Students who have all of the prerequisites (<a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/cms-filesystem-action?file=pdfs/calendar/bus.pdf">minimum average of C in either BUS&#8211;2002(3) or BUS&#8211;2010, BUS&#8211;2103(3) or PSYC&#8211;2440(3), BUS&#8211;2210(3), BUS&#8211;2440(3) and BUS&#8211;2501(3)</a>), who are given priority by the University to register and who are placed on a waitlist if there is not enough space.</li>
<li>Students who have completed the prerequisites <em>but not with the required minimum grade average</em>.</li>
<li>Students who do not have the prerequisites but who <em>are taking one or more prerequisites concurrent with this course</em>.</li>
<li>Students who do not have the prerequisites but <em>are not taking any prerequisites concurrently</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A student in group 1 would simply wait to see if a spot becomes available before the add/drop date. If a student is in any of the other three groups, they should attend class until the add/drop date. <strong>Students may be asked for their transcript in order to determine the appropriate group for their circumstances</strong>. Where demand by students in groups 2, 3 or 4 exceeds the supply of spots in the course, a lottery may be held.</p>

<h3 id="make-upclasses">MAKE-UP CLASSES</h3>

<p>Other unforeseen interruptions (e.g., illness or weather) will be accommodated by scheduling another class session after the formal lecture sessions have ceased.</p>

<h3 id="coursedescription">COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>This course offers an advanced investigation into the salient parameters which underpin international business operations undertaken by newly–formed and established multinational enterprises. Broad topics to be considered include strategy and market entry, financial markets, regional political and economic environments, international trade and globalisation and regionalism. By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the contribution of globalisation to the foundations of international business;</li>
<li>Recognise the role of politics, law and the wider social environment in international business and trade;</li>
<li>Analyse global markets in the context of structure and strategy and the firm-level;</li>
<li>Utilise quantitative techniques for assessing international production capabilities and efficiencies;</li>
<li>Articulate aspects of international market entry strategies; and</li>
<li>Link concepts of ethics, corporate social responsibility and environmental responsibility to international business activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is a fourth-year course, there is a strong expectation that students undertake, on a regular basis, substantial readings (both assigned and independent) from academic and non-academic sources.</p>

<p>This course requires the following prerequisites: A minimum average of C in either BUS- 2002(3) or BUS&#8211;2010, BUS&#8211;2103(3) or PSYC&#8211;2440(3), BUS&#8211;2210(3), BUS&#8211;2440(3) and BUS&#8211;2501(3). Students who hold these requirements will be given first preference to any and all available slots in the course.</p>

<h3 id="communication">COMMUNICATION</h3>

<p>I will hold weekly office hours during the semester in the hour before class. If this time is not convenient, other arrangements (e.g., phone or Skype) are possible.</p>

<h3 id="criticaldates">CRITICAL DATES</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="requiredreadings">REQUIRED READINGS</h3>

<p>This course is <em>very</em> reading-intensive in the service of expanding one&#8217;s understanding of the subject matter. </p>

<p>We will be using readings from three sources: (1) a textbook, (2) a selection of case studies, and (3) academic journal articles. </p>

<h4 id="textbook">Textbook</h4>

<p>The required textbook for this course will be Rugman, A.M and Collinson, S. (2012), <em>International Business</em>. This is an excellent text and will be one that most students will retain well after graduation. The textbook is available at the <a href="http://www.bkstr.com/winnipegstore/home">UW Bookstore</a>.</p>

<p>While the text should be considered <em>required</em>, it will not necessarily be our primary focus on a week-to-week basis. In many cases, the lectures and discussions shall use the textbook material as a <em>foundation</em> for the topics, discussions and case analysis activities rather than systematically cover the material itself. It will be assumed that students have read the relevant chapters as identified elsewhere in this course outline. All assigned readings from the textbook should be considered examinable for any and all examinations.</p>

<h4 id="casestudies">Case studies</h4>

<p>We will be using a few case studies in this course. The collection of case studies <a href="https://www.iveycases.com/CoursepackView.aspx?id=8126">can be purchased online in .pdf format for CDN$17.00</a>. Further details and timing/coordination with specific modules will be forthcoming during the semester.</p>

<h4 id="journalarticles">Journal articles</h4>

<p>In addition to the textbook, a number of readings from academic journals will be required for each module. These are listed below by module and should also to be considered examinable for any test or exam. The readings should be available through the <a href="http://library.uwinnipeg.ca">UWinnipeg library system</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the list of journal article readings <strong>will likely change</strong> as we progress through the semester. This is because we may discover additional readings that may be of use or interest in our discussions.</p>

<h3 id="resourcesincludinglecturenotes">RESOURCES (INCLUDING LECTURE NOTES)</h3>

<p>Students should visit the <a href="https://dtduval.github.io/BUS-4220-notes.html">Daily Notes</a> page on this site on a regular basis. This is where you will find the most up-to-date information of what has taken place in the course as well as what is coming up. The page will be updated very frequently, and should be treated more or less as a journal of the course. </p>

<p>As this is a discussion-based course, there will be very few slides (i.e., powerpoints) associated with this course. If slides are shown, these will be posted to Nexus or can be made available from me via email.</p>

<h4 id="self-directedreadings">Self-directed readings</h4>

<p>While this course is, again, very reading intensive, students may derive some benefit from additional readings on specific topics of interest. The University has substantial access to a number of excellent academic journals which should be consulted to enhance your understanding and learning of the course topics. These include the following, among others:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>International Business Review</em></li>
<li><em>Journal of International Business Studies</em></li>
<li><em>World Development</em></li>
<li><em>Geoforum</em></li>
<li><em>Organizational Studies</em></li>
<li><em>Ivey Business Journal</em></li>
<li><em>Journal of Transnational Management</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Further, the following will likely be useful for many of the concepts we discuss:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.financialpost.com/">Financial Post</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a> (London)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">Guardian</a> (UK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qz.com">Quartz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://unctad.org/en/pages/DIAE/World%20Investment%20Report/WIR-Series.aspx">UNCTAD&#8217;s World Investment Reports</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com">Foreign Policy</a> (may need a free account)</li>
</ol>

<p>At the very least, students should be reading, on a regular basis, <a href="http://www.economist.com"><em>The Economist</em></a> and [<em>Bloomberg Businessweek]<a href="http://www.businessweek.com">18</a></em>. There are significant resources available from the <a href="http://libguides.uwinnipeg.ca/bus">subject guide for International Business and Marketing</a>, which is available through the <a href="http://library.uwinnipeg.ca">UWinnipeg library</a>.</p>

<h3 id="courseformat">COURSE FORMAT</h3>

<p>This course is very much discussion-based. Students should not necessarily expect the class sessions to follow the textbook material explicitly. Volunteers will be called upon in advance to develop short presentations for delivery in class on a particular topic. These initiatives and activities will be considered when awarding contribution grades in the course (see elsewhere in this outline).</p>

<h3 id="expectationsgoverningpoliciesandgeneralinformation">EXPECTATIONS, GOVERNING POLICIES, AND GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>In general, you are expected to read the assigned material (e.g., chapters assigned from the textbook, case studies or readings from a journal) <em>before</em> you come to class. Lectures may summarise assigned material, but more often will expand key points, introduce extensive complementary material, and/or make connections across topics or to relevant current events.</p>

<p>All the knowledge and information necessary for successful completion of this course with a high mark does not come <em>solely</em> from the lectures or the textbook. Both are an integral part of the course. For Introductory courses (such as BUS 1201), the textbook forms the &#8220;backbone&#8221; of the course. For more advanced courses, the readings are central to the direction and content of the course. Either way, it will be assumed that you are keeping up with the assigned readings. The class sessions shall be designed to amplify, clarify and, in some instances, supersede the assigned readings. On many occasions, material covered in the class sessions <strong>will not feature</strong> in the textbook.</p>

<p>You are responsible for all course-related announcements made in class. Further, it is your responsibility to be familiar with Section VII of the most current University Course Calendar dealing with Academic Regulations and Policies. This section covers classroom regulations, grading, transcripts, challenge for credit, academic standing, student discipline (academic and non-academic misconduct), appeals including grade appeals, University Policies and Codes, and graduation. The delivery of this course is governed by these regulations and policies, along with all other policies contained within the current University of Winnipeg General Calendar.</p>

<h3 id="classroomconductandprotocol">CLASSROOM CONDUCT AND PROTOCOL</h3>

<p>Despite the somewhat informal nature of my teaching style, some classroom behaviour can be somewhat disruptive, even if it may seem rather minor or inconsequential. For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Talking</strong>. Two students carrying on a conversation can quickly distract not only those around them, but me as well. If you absolutely need to discuss something with your neighbour that is unrelated to the class, we ask that you please leave the room. We will not be offended, and you are more than welcome to come back when finished. If your discussion is related to the class, let us know!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong>. You are very welcome to have your laptop open during class. I will often call upon people to check a fact in the middle of the lecture, so having technology at the ready can be rather useful. The same goes for tablets and phones, but please keep these on silent. If you are expecting a critical phone call, you are more than welcome to come to class, but just leave the room when that call comes through.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Late arrivals or early departures</strong>. Sometimes it is just not possible to come on time (weather, late buses, medical appointments, etc.). This is understandable. Beyond these instances, however, we ask that you try to keep late arrivals and/or early departures to a minimum as they can be quite distracting for the entire class.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The purpose of our classroom sessions is to explore the issues pertinent to the course itself, but to do so in a safe environment. All points of view and questions are welcome, but please offer these with respect. Disruptive and disrespectful behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>

<h3 id="anoteonplagiarismandacademicmisconduct">A NOTE ON PLAGIARISM AND ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</h3>

<p>Plagiarism is submitting work in a course that is not one&#8217;s own. This includes, but is not limited to, not using quotation marks, citation and footnotes when quoting directly, or not using footnotes or citations when quoting indirectly or paraphrasing to indicate the source of the ideas or work of another author. Plagiarism can also refer to submitting original work for credit in two or more different courses without the knowledge or prior agreement of the respective Professors. Dishonest or attempted dishonest practice during tests or exams or in the preparation of other course work is considered cheating will be brought to the Senate Academic Misconduct Committee.</p>

<p>Students should note that software designed to assist in detecting potential instances of plagiarism may be used in this course.</p>

<p>Students are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the University&#8217;s policy on academic misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="guidingprinciples">GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>Students with documented disabilities, temporary or chronic medical conditions, requiring academic accommodations for tests/exams (e.g., private space) or during lectures/laboratories (e.g., note-takers) are encouraged to contact Accessibility Services (AS) at 786&#8211;9771 or accessibilityservices@uwinnipeg.ca to discuss appropriate options. All information about a student&#8217;s disability or medical condition remains confidential. .</p>

<p>Students who plan to conduct research interviews, focus groups, surveys, or any other method of collecting data from any person, even a family member, must obtain the approval of the appropriate ethics committee before commencing data collection. Exceptions are research activities in class as a learning exercise. See for submission requirements and deadlines.</p>

<p>All students, faculty and staff have the right to participate, learn and work in an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination. The UW Respectful Working and Learning Environment Policy may be found online at <a href="www.uwinnipeg.ca/respect">www.uwinnipeg.ca/respect</a>.</p>

<p>Students may choose not to attend classes or write examinations on holy days of their religion, but they must notify their instructors at least two weeks in advance. Instructors will then provide opportunity for students to make up work examinations without penalty. A list of religious holidays can be found <a href="http://uwinnipeg.ca/academics/calendar/docs/important-notes.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>UWinnipeg promotes a scent-free environment. Please be respectful of the needs of classmates and the instructor by avoiding the use of scented products while attending lectures. Exposure to perfumes and other scented products (such as lotion) can trigger serious health reactions in persons with asthma, allergies, migraines or chemical sensitivities.</p>

<h3 id="evaluationcriteria">EVALUATION CRITERIA</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mid–term exam (30%)</strong>. An in–class mid–term exam will be held. The format of the exam shall be short answer questions. Photo identification will be required. A few governing regulations for the mid–term exam:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic calculators or financial calculators may be used for the exams.</li>
<li>Mobile Phones with calculators, PDAs, other Organisers, or programmable calculators will NOT be permitted to be used as calculators.</li>
<li>Mobile phones must be turned off.</li>
<li>The use of dictionaries or electronic devices, including translators, will be prohibited.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Individual Research Paper (50%)</strong>. Details and expectations relating to the research paper will be discussed at length in the early part of the course. Additional documentation and supporting documents will be posted to Nexus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contribution (20%)</strong>. Individual classes for this course will often be based around collaborative discussions, not entirely dissimilar to seminars. Much of these wider group discussions will centre around the readings/cases assigned, and thus it is imperative for students to come to class having <strong>read</strong> and <strong>annotated</strong> these readings, including the textbook. This also means you should bring the readings with you in order to be fully prepared. Students will be responsible for active contribution (<em>not <strong>just</strong> participation and/or attendance</em>) in class sessions. Students will be expected to deliver brief presentations on topics assigned by me to leading and contributing to discussions. The contribution criteria, including the qualitative (and nominal) meaning associated with its weighted value, shall be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excellent (18&#8211;20%) - Demonstrates consistent on–time attendance, preparation, and contributes constructively to class activities and discussions; consistently demonstrates insight by asking questions, making statements that add to and facilitate the class discussion, or building upon others&#8217; comments.</li>
<li>Very Good (14&#8211;17%) &amp; Demonstrates consistent on–time attendance, preparation, and constructively contributes in all class activities and discussions; demonstrates insight by asking questions or making statements that are relevant, enhance, and facilitate the class discussion.</li>
<li>Fair (10&#8211;13%) &amp; Demonstrates consistent attendance and preparation; occasionally contributes to class discussions, regularly participates in other class activities; may occasionally arrive late to class.</li>
<li>Marginal (5—9%) &amp; Demonstrates marginal, inconsistent and/or infrequent attendance, timeliness and contribution in and to class activities; may occasionally be unengaged in class activities and/or is disruptive/distracting or disrespectful in class; is frequently not prepared, regularly arrives late to class.</li>
<li>Poor (0—4%) &amp; Demonstrates consistently poor attendance and consistently poor preparation; is unengaged or fails to contribute in class activities; may be disruptive/distracting or disrespectful in class to others.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>How are contribution grades awarded?</em></strong> In many cases, grades for contribution or participation can encourage unnecessary competition by inadvertently rewarding quantity over quality. To avoid this, the grade students receive for contribution shall reflect my <em>overall</em> assessment of their contribution. For instance, if a student attends and contributes in a meaningful and scholarly way on a regular basis, their grade will likely be very high. If they attend class but never contribute, their score will naturally be extremely low. To give students a better perspective on how they are doing with respect to contribution, I will, upon request, provide on the date of the mid–term exam an <em>interim</em>, <em>indicative</em> and <em>non–binding</em> score (out of 20) that reflects contribution–to–date. It is important to note that this interim grade does not have any bearing on the final contribution grade earned for this course (awarded on the final day of class). Rather, it is meant to give the student some idea as to how much or how little contribution is being recognised and recorded. (The scale above itself is adapted from the criteria used by Professor Karen Harlos, University of Winnipeg.)</p>

<h3 id="latesubmissionofassessments">LATE SUBMISSION OF ASSESSMENTS</h3>

<p>The policy for late submission of assessments is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any and all internal assessments <strong>must</strong> be submitted no later that what is specified in this Course Outline. <strong>Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0 (zero) for the assessment.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions to this policy include serious illness, family emergency, or other emergency situations. Please be in touch with me on <a href="da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca">da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca</a> to discuss circumstances. Official documentation may be requested, although the provision of such documentation shall in no way predetermine an outcome with respect to assigning a grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure of computer equipment (for whatever reason) will <strong>not</strong> be considered as an exception to this policy. You are responsible for ensuring you have adequate backups of all your work. You should take any and all precautions to ensure that you are able to submit your assessment on–time.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="markingproceduresexcludingmid–termexam">MARKING PROCEDURES (excluding mid–term exam)</h3>

<p>Grades will be given as a percentage based on the weighted value of the assessment. Thus, if an assessment (a mid–term exam, for instance) has a weighted value of 20%, then you will receive a grade out of 20.</p>

<p>Letter grades are not assigned to individual pieces of assessment. Only the total for the course will be converted to a letter grade, and this is only done after the grades are reviewed internally within the Department of Business and Administration and by the Senate of the University of Winnipeg. The letter grade you earn for the course can range from an F (failure) to an A+ (highest possible grade).</p>

<h3 id="functionalinterpretationofgrades">FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF GRADES</h3>

<p>A standard grading scale is utilised in all courses within the Department of Business and Administration. Note that this may differ from other Departments or courses at the University of Winnipeg. The scale itself is below, along with a functional interpretation of the meaning of specific grades as they pertaining to assignments. Note that this scale is specific to this course only.</p>

<ul>
<li>A+ (&gt;90) - Outstanding, essentially flawless, innovative, demonstrates exceptional understanding</li>
<li>A (85–89) - Outstanding, clear and concise, demonstrates well–above–average understanding</li>
<li>A- (80–84) - Highly polished and logical</li>
<li>B+ (75–79) - Solid, but minimally flawed</li>
<li>B (70–74) - Solid, but a few errors, demonstrates better–than–average understanding</li>
<li>C+ (65–69) - Minimal understanding, no originality, somewhat repetitive of sources</li>
<li>C (60–64) - Average (elementary) understanding, egregious errors in concepts, material and/or layout</li>
<li>D (50–59) - Barely adequate, poorly organised, below–average understanding, numerous errors</li>
<li>F (&lt;50) data-preserve-html-node=&#8220;true&#8221; - No obvious understanding, unprofessional, very poor</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="feedbackonassessmentsexcludingmid–termexam">FEEDBACK ON ASSESSMENTS (excluding mid–term exam)</h3>

<p>In lieu of written comments, feedback on internal assessments (excluding the final exam, if applicable) will be offered via student–initiated, one–on–one consultation meetings with me during my office hours (see <a href="www.dtduval.com">www.dtduval.com</a>). This service is available to you regardless of the grade earned on an assessment. Importantly, when you make an appointment it shall <strong>not</strong> be perceived by me as a request for a higher grade. Rather, it is an opportunity for you to receive direct advice and guidance regarding your writing style, structure, logic and argumentation and the use of references/secondary material.</p>

<h3 id="moduletopicsandcontent">MODULE TOPICS AND CONTENT</h3>

<p>The course is broadly divided up into a series of five modules. Where time allows, we may introduce topics relating to current events <em>or</em> specific topics brought forward by members of the class.</p>

<h4 id="moduleone:introductionandglobalisationweeks1and2">MODULE ONE: INTRODUCTION and GLOBALISATION (WEEKS 1 and 2)</h4>

<h4 id="moduletwo:internationalbusinessenvironmentsweeks3and4">MODULE TWO: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS (WEEKS 3 and 4)</h4>

<h4 id="modulethree:internationalpoliticsandtradeweeks5and6">MODULE THREE: INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND TRADE (WEEKS 5 and 6)</h4>

<h4 id="modulefour:globalfinancialsystemsweeks7and8">MODULE FOUR: GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS (WEEKS 7 and 8)</h4>

<h4 id="modulefive:strategyweeks91011and12">MODULE FIVE: STRATEGY (WEEKS 9, 10, 11 and 12)</h4>

<p><strong>Due to unforeseen circumstances, changes to some aspects of this course (excluding the assessment structure) may be necessary. Any and all changes will be communicated in class. As well, you should thus check carefully the &#8220;Course Outline Change Log&#8221; below to ensure that you have the most current version.
