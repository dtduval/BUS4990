### CONTACT

David Timothy Duval   
Office Hours: held weekly in the hour before class (see [my website](http://www.dtduval.com) to make an appointment)
Office: 3BC28 (Buhler Centre)   
Email: [da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca][2]    

### LECTURE TIMES AND LOCATION

Formal meeting times are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 3:45 in 3BC57.  In the event of inclement weather that may prevent the class from being run, check Nexus for any announcements.

### MAKE-UP CLASSES

Other unforeseen interruptions (e.g., illness or weather) will be accommodated by scheduling another class session after the formal lecture sessions have ceased.

### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course offers an advanced investigation into the salient parameters which underpin international business operations undertaken by newly–formed and established multinational enterprises. Broad topics to be considered include strategy and market entry, financial markets, regional political and economic environments, international trade and globalisation and regionalism. By the end of this course, students should be able to:

* Understand the contribution of globalisation to the foundations of international business;
* Recognise the role of politics, law and the wider social environment in international business and trade;
* Analyse global markets in the context of structure and strategy and the firm-level;
* Utilise various techniques for assessing international production capabilities and efficiencies;
* Articulate and evaluate critically international market entry strategies; and
* Link concepts of ethics, corporate social responsibility and environmental responsibility to international business activities.

As this is a fourth-year course, there is a strong expectation that students undertake, on a regular basis, **substantial** readings (both assigned and independent) from academic and non-academic sources.

This course requires the following requisite courses: BUS-2002 or BUS-2010, and
BUS-2103 or PSYC-2440, and BUS-2210 and BUS-2440 and BUS-2501, all with a minimum grade of C (prerequisite). Students who hold these requirements will be given first preference to any and all available slots in the course. As a matter of Department policy, entry into Year IV courses is restricted to those who have completed the prerequisites. Entry for those without the prerequisites may be possible, but this is at the discretion of the Chair of the Department and/or the course director.

### COMMUNICATION

I will hold weekly office hours during the semester in the hour or so before class.  If this time is not convenient, other arrangements (e.g., phone or Skype) are possible.

### CRITICAL DATES

* 4 January 2018 — Lectures begin
* 19 February 2018 — Start of reading Week
* 26 February 2018 @ 19:00CST – Journal articles review assessment due
* 14 March 2018 — Voluntary Withdrawal Date without academic penalty
* 10 April 2018 @ 19:00CST — Research paper due (see below for submission guidelines)
* Note that there are _no_ tests or exams in this course (see assessment details below)

### MODULES and READINGS

#####  MODULES

The course is ostensibly split into a series of four formal modules:

 MODULE ONE (Introduction and Globalisation (Weeks 1 and 2))

The purpose of this module is to evaluate critically the current state of globalisation and its impact on international business initiatives.  We will focus on globalisation as a concept and how it is manifested, but we will also explore critiques of the *practice* of globalisation by multinational firms (and governments, to some extent). From this, we will explore recent movements toward regionalism and nationalism and discuss what impact this can have on business activities and transactions.

 MODULE TWO (International Business Environments (Weeks 3 and 4))

The wider international business environment is the focus of this module. Here we will explore the diverse social and culture dimensions that impact international trade, investment, and commerce. This will also lead us to discuss ethics from an international perspective, including an investigation of global efforts at mitigating climate change.  

 MODULE THREE (International Politics and Trade (Weeks 5 and 6))

As an extension of Module Two, the wider international business environment also takes into consideration global politics and law, how states regulate business activities, and competition policy. We will also explore in–depth how transformative political and legal structures can impact on internationalisation efforts of firms. We will examine trade costs (e.g., transport, customs, currency and transaction costs) and consider carefully regional trade blocs and integration, free trade principles and policy and emerging markets. Quantitatively, we will investigate the nature of political and operational risk in multinational strategy using in–class exercises.  We will also consider gravity models.

 MODULE FOUR (International Strategy (Weeks 7 through 12))

This module shall explore the role of transnational corporations and their role in global production networks, entry modes, the role of technology (and knowledge transfer), strategies for negotiation, and international HR and organisation structuring models. We will also use techniques to assess short- and long-run multi-country production strategies.  Global financial systems play an integral role in international business efforts. Here, we focus on government balance of payments, exchange rates, the international monetary system, the gold standard, international trade and investment theory and government / business relations.

 NOTES ON COURSE DELIVERY

This course is not planned and executed on a class-by-class basis.  Instead, it is somewhat fluid and organic.  As will be discussed in the first class, students will be heavily involved as co-producers of course content throughout the semester.  The intent is to give enough time to cover the broad subject matter but, at the same time, allow for discussion and debate on current issues and topics of interest to students in the class.  

The day-by-day class sessions are mapped out on the **Daily Notes** page, which is available here on Nexus.  The page, which is dynamic and will change as the course progresses, is where you will find the most up-to-date information on what has taken place in the course as well as, more importantly, what is coming up.  Because it will be updated very frequently, you should refer to it multiple times per week and most definitely before class.  

#####  READINGS

In the service of expanding your understanding of the subject matter and, at the same, giving you a realistic picture of the expected workload and effort you are expected to put it, this course is _very_ reading-intensive.  We will be using readings from three sources: (1) a selection of case studies that you will purchase from Ivey, (2) academic journal articles available through the UW library system and (3) miscellaneous online materials available through David's Pinboard account (https://pinboard.in/u:dtduval).  You will find details on the readings associated with each module on the **Resources** page here on Nexus.  The precise schedule of when we will be addressing each reading will appear on the **Daily Notes** page, also here on Nexus.

For each module, volunteers will be sought to present to the class specific readings or cases.  Volunteers will be expected to give a synopsis of their reading and lead the class in a brief discussion.  Naturally, these activities play a role in your contribution grade in the course.

To volunteer to present any of these to the class, [go to this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing)

 Textbook

There is no set text for this course.  Instead, I will ask that you acquire any new or second-hand textbook that has been published in the past seven years or so.  I will provide broad guidance throughout the course on the subjects that we will be covering.  It is very likely that the text you have selected will cover these topics.  If you are looking for a recommended text: International Business, 3rd edition by Oded Shenkar, Yadong Luo, and Tailan Chi.  The price of the book is over $200, so I have told the bookstore not to order any in at that price.  Instead, you may rent the text at [https://www.vitalsource.com/referral?term=9781135067571](https://www.vitalsource.com/referral?term=9781135067571).

If you have access to the previous text used in this course (Rugman and Collinson's International Business), you are welcome to use that one as background reading for the subjects we will cover.

 Case studies

We will be using formal case studies in this course.  The collection of case studies is available for purchase online.  Follow these steps to purchase:

1. Go to the Ivey Publishing website at www.iveycases.com
2. Log in to your existing account or click "Register" to create a new account and follow the prompts to complete the registration. If registering, choose the "Student User" role.
4. Click on this link or copy into your browser: [https://www.iveycases.com/CoursepackView.aspx?id=12335](https://www.iveycases.com/CoursepackView.aspx?id=12335)
5. Click "Add to Cart".
6. You may choose to order in either print or digital format, but I would recommend digital as shipping charges will otherwise apply.  To order the material in digital format, check "digital download" and click "OK".  To order a printed copy for delivery, enter the print quantity required and click "OK". Please note that shipping charges will apply.
7. Go to the Shopping Cart (located at the top of the page), click "Checkout", and complete the checkout process.
8. When payment has been processed successfully, an Order Confirmation will be emailed to you immediately and you will see the Order Confirmation screen.  If you ordered digital copies: Click "Download your Digital Items" or go to "My Orders" to access the file.

**IMPORTANT: Access to downloadable files will expire 30 days from the order date, so be sure to save a copy on your computer. The downloadable file is a PDF document that can be opened using Adobe Reader.**

*This material is for your personal use only and is not to be shared or distributed in any form.*

 Journal articles

A number of readings from academic journals will be required for each module. These are listed in an online spreadsheet where you can sign up to present readings to the class.  Readings will be discussed in class, and students interested in securing the best possible contribution grade should read and prepare discussion notes for these readings.

A very easy way to track down most of the readings indicated in the spreadsheet is to use a UW-linked Google Scholar portal [available here][6].  After you click "Connect", you may be asked to sign in, after which you can use Google Scholar to search for the title of the reading.

 Miscellaneous online materials

Through David's Pinboard account (https://pinboard.in/u:dtduval), various readings will be discussed in class.  Pinboard bookmarks are arranged by modeule (e.g., 4220-1, 4220-2, etc.).

 Additional self-directed readings (which can be used for contribution grades)

While this course is, again, **very** reading intensive, students may derive some benefit from additional readings on specific topics of interest.  The University has substantial access to a number of excellent academic journals which should be consulted to enhance your understanding and learning of the course topics.

At the very least, students should be reading, on a regular basis, various news sources such as the Globe and Mail, the Financial Post, the Guardian, Bloomberg Businessweek and Business News Network. There are significant resources available from the [subject guide for International Business and Marketing][19], which is available through the [UWinnipeg library][6].

Note that you can present any independent (self-directed) readings to the class as part of your contribution grade.  See elsewhere in this outline for details on how contribution grades are awarded.

### COURSE FORMAT

This course is run in a seminar format that privileges discussion over lectures.  Students are encouraged to read widely and bring new readings or links to class as is relevant.  There will not be any slides (i.e., powerpoints) associated with this course.

### EXPECTATIONS, GOVERNING POLICIES, AND GENERAL INFORMATION

In general, **you are expected to read the assigned material _before_ you come to class**. Lectures may summarise assigned material, but more often will expand key points, introduce extensive complementary material, and/or make connections across topics or to relevant current events.

You are responsible for all course-related announcements made in class. Further, it is your responsibility to be familiar with Section VII of the most current University Course Calendar dealing with Academic Regulations and Policies. This section covers classroom regulations, grading, transcripts, challenge for credit, academic standing, student discipline (academic and non-academic misconduct), appeals including grade appeals, University Policies and Codes, and graduation. The delivery of this course is governed by these regulations and policies, along with all other policies contained within the current University of Winnipeg General Calendar.

### CLASSROOM CONDUCT AND PROTOCOL

Despite the somewhat informal nature of my teaching style, some classroom behaviour can be somewhat disruptive, even if it may seem rather minor or inconsequential. For instance:

1. **Talking**. Two students carrying on a conversation can quickly distract not only those around them, but me as well. If you absolutely need to discuss something with your neighbour that is unrelated to the class, we ask that you please leave the room. We will not be offended, and you are more than welcome to come back when finished. If your discussion is related to the class, let us know!

2. **Technology**. You are very welcome to have your laptop open during class. I will often call upon people to check a fact in the middle of the lecture, so having technology at the ready can be rather useful. The same goes for tablets and phones, but please keep these on silent. If you are expecting a critical phone call, you are more than welcome to come to class, but just leave the room when that call comes through.

3. **Late arrivals or early departures**. Sometimes it is just not possible to come on time (weather, late buses, medical appointments, etc.). This is understandable. Beyond these instances, however, we ask that you try to keep late arrivals and/or early departures to a minimum as they can be quite distracting for the entire class.

The purpose of our classroom sessions is to explore the issues pertinent to the course itself, but to do so in a safe environment. All points of view and questions are welcome, but please offer these with respect. Disruptive and disrespectful behaviour will not be tolerated.

### A NOTE ON PLAGIARISM AND ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT

Plagiarism is submitting work in a course that is not one's own. This includes, but is not limited to, not using quotation marks, citation and footnotes when quoting directly, or not using footnotes or citations when quoting indirectly or paraphrasing to indicate the source of the ideas or work of another author. Plagiarism can also refer to submitting original work for credit in two or more different courses without the knowledge or prior agreement of the respective Professors. Dishonest or attempted dishonest practice during tests or exams or in the preparation of other course work is considered cheating will be brought to the Senate Academic Misconduct Committee.

Students should note that software designed to assist in detecting potential instances of plagiarism may be used in this course.

Students are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the University's policy on academic misconduct (available at http://uwinnipeg.ca/new-faculty-handbook/appeals-and-academic-misconduct.html).

### GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Students with documented disabilities, temporary or chronic medical conditions, requiring academic accommodations for tests/exams (e.g., private space) or during lectures/laboratories (e.g., note-takers) are encouraged to contact Accessibility Services (AS) at 786-9771 or accessibilityservices@uwinnipeg.ca to discuss appropriate options. All information about a student's disability or medical condition remains confidential.

Students who plan to conduct research interviews, focus groups, surveys, or any other method of collecting data from any person, even a family member, must obtain the approval of the appropriate ethics committee before commencing data collection. Exceptions are research activities in class as a learning exercise.

All students, faculty and staff have the right to participate, learn and work in an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination. The UW Respectful Working and Learning Environment Policy may be found online at [www.uwinnipeg.ca/respect][20].

Students may choose not to attend classes or write examinations on holy days of their religion, but they must notify their instructors at least two weeks in advance. Instructors will then provide opportunity for students to make up work examinations without penalty. A list of religious holidays can be found [here]( http://uwinnipeg.ca/academics/calendar/docs/important-notes.pdf)

UWinnipeg promotes a scent-free environment. Please be respectful of the needs of classmates and the instructor by avoiding the use of scented products while attending lectures. Exposure to perfumes and other scented products (such as lotion) can trigger serious health reactions in persons with asthma, allergies, migraines or chemical sensitivities.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA

1) **Journal articles review assessment (30%)**. The purpose of this assessment is prepare you for the analytical work you will undertake of academic sources as you write your research paper (below).  You are tasked with reviewing three (3) academic journal articles that discuss any topic relevant to the course.  Journal articles can be sourced from the UW library.  [This website from the library](http://library.uwinnipeg.ca/help-with-research/searching-for-sources.html) is a good starting point.  As well, there is also an [excellent subject guide](http://libguides.uwinnipeg.ca/bus) that will be of use for both this assessment and your research paper.

The articles you select cannot already be selected by David for wider discussion in the course nor can they be articles that you are using for your final research paper, but otherwise it is entirely your choice.  

For your review of each article you must address:

* The key point(s), including the wider problem/issue being addressed;
* The methods used;
* Opportunities for further research;
* Strengths and deficiencies (in your opinion) with the methods, interpretation and conclusions.

Your review of any single article should be between 1000 and 1200 words, thus for all three articles you will be writing between 2400 and 3600 words.  Grades for each review can earn a maximum of 10 marks.  The best grades will be rewarded to students who (a) pick articles relevant to the course, (b) address the four criteria above in a detailed and critical manner (a good way is to bring in additional sources to achieve this), and (c) draw specific parallels to the study of international business as discussed in the class and/or in any international business textbook.  90% of your grade in this assessment is based on content, with the remainder allocated to presentation, grammar, spelling, etc.  The format of your review is at your discretion.

Submit your review by email David on da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca.  All reviews must be received no later than the date and time indicated elsewhere in this outline.  Students should familiarise themselves the late submission policy also detailed elsewhere in this outline.

2) **Individual Research Paper (50%)**. Details and expectations relating to the research paper will be discussed at length in the early part of the course.  Additional documentation and supporting documents will be posted to Nexus.  You are to submit your paper as a single .pdf via the dropbox facility on Nexus.  Submissions will not be accepted after the due date indicated elsewhere in this course outline, and students should familiarise themselves the late submission policy also detailed elsewhere in this outline.

3) **Contribution (20%)**. Individual classes for this course will often be based around collaborative discussions, not entirely dissimilar to seminars. Much of these wider group discussions will centre around the readings/cases assigned, and thus it is imperative for students to come to class having **read** and **annotated** these readings. This also means you should bring the readings with you in order to be fully prepared. Students will be responsible for active contribution (_not **just** participation and/or attendance_) in class sessions. Students will be expected to deliver brief presentations on topics assigned by me to leading and contributing to discussions. The contribution criteria, including the qualitative (and nominal) meaning associated with its weighted value, shall be as follows:

* Excellent (18-20%) - Demonstrates consistent on–time attendance, preparation, and contributes constructively to class activities and discussions; consistently demonstrates insight by asking questions, making statements that add to and facilitate the class discussion, or building upon others' comments.
* Very Good (14-17%) - Demonstrates consistent on–time attendance, preparation, and constructively contributes in all class activities and discussions; demonstrates insight by asking questions or making statements that are relevant, enhance, and facilitate the class discussion.h
* Fair (10-13%) - Demonstrates consistent attendance and preparation; occasionally contributes to class discussions, regularly participates in other class activities; may occasionally arrive late to class.
* Marginal (5—9%) - Demonstrates marginal, inconsistent and/or infrequent attendance, timeliness and contribution in and to class activities; may occasionally be unengaged in class activities and/or is disruptive/distracting or disrespectful in class; is frequently not prepared, regularly arrives late to class.
* Poor (0—4%) - Demonstrates consistently poor attendance and consistently poor preparation; is unengaged or fails to contribute in class activities; may be disruptive/distracting or disrespectful in class to others.

**_What can you do to earn marks toward contribution>_** There are several ways:
* Prepare one of the Ivey case studies and present it, along with critical discussion questions, to the class
* Present one of the assigned readings to the class
* Make a presentation on a reading (not prescribed) that you have found or come across.
* Regularly contribute to the discussion by preparing the topic ahead of time.
* Asking class visitors (guest lectures) questions that demonstrate you prepared in advance for their visit.

**_How are contribution grades awarded?_** In many cases, grades for contribution or participation can encourage unnecessary competition by inadvertently rewarding quantity over quality. To avoid this, the grade students receive for contribution shall reflect my _overall_ assessment of their contribution. For instance, if a student attends and contributes in a meaningful and scholarly way on a regular basis, their grade will likely be very high. If they attend class but never contribute, their score will naturally be extremely low. To give students a better perspective on how they are doing with respect to contribution, I will, upon request, provide on the date of the mid–term exam an _interim_, _indicative_ and _non–binding_ score (out of 20) that reflects contribution–to–date. It is important to note that this interim grade does not have any bearing on the final contribution grade earned for this course (awarded on the final day of class). Rather, it is meant to give the student some idea as to how much or how little contribution is being recognised and recorded. (The scale above itself is adapted from the criteria used by Professor Karen Harlos, University of Winnipeg.)

### LATE SUBMISSION OF ASSESSMENTS

The policy for late submission of assessments is as follows:

1. Any and all internal assessments **must** be submitted no later that what is specified in this Course Outline. **Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0 (zero) for the assessment.**

2. Exceptions to this policy include serious illness, family emergency, or other emergency situations. Please be in touch with me on [da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca][22] to discuss circumstances. Official documentation may be requested, although the provision of such documentation shall in no way predetermine an outcome with respect to assigning a grade.

3. Failure of computer equipment (for whatever reason) will **not** be considered as an exception to this policy. You are responsible for ensuring you have adequate backups of all your work. You should take any and all precautions to ensure that you are able to submit your assessment on–time.

MARKING PROCEDURES

Grades will be given as a percentage based on the weighted value of the assessment. Thus, if an assessment (the contribution grade, for instance) has a weighted value of 20%, then you will receive a grade out of 20.

Letter grades are not assigned to individual pieces of assessment. Only the total for the course will be converted to a letter grade, and this is only done after the grades are reviewed internally within the Department of Business and Administration and by the Senate of the University of Winnipeg. The letter grade you earn for the course can range from an F (failure) to an A+ (highest possible grade).

### FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF GRADES

A standard grading scale is utilised in all courses within the Department of Business and Administration. Note that this may differ from other Departments or courses at the University of Winnipeg. The scale itself is below, along with a functional interpretation of the meaning of specific grades as they pertaining to assignments. Note that this scale is specific to this course only.

* A+ (>90) Outstanding, essentially flawless, innovative, demonstrates exceptional understanding
* A (85–89) Outstanding, clear and concise, demonstrates well–above–average understanding
* A- (80–84) Highly polished and logical
* B+ (75–79) Solid, but minimally flawed
* B (70–74) Solid, but a few errors, demonstrates better–than–average understanding
* C+ (65–69) Minimal understanding, no originality, somewhat repetitive of sources
* C (60–64) Average (elementary) understanding, egregious errors in concepts, material and/or layout
* D (50–59) Barely adequate, poorly organised, below–average understanding, numerous errors
* F (<50) No obvious understanding, unprofessional, very poor

### FEEDBACK ON ASSESSMENTS (excluding mid–term exam)

In lieu of written comments, feedback on internal assessments (excluding the final exam, if applicable) will be offered via student–initiated, one–on–one consultation meetings with me during my office hours (see [www.dtduval.com][23]). This service is available to you regardless of the grade earned on an assessment. Importantly, when you make an appointment it shall **not** be perceived by me as a request for a higher grade. Rather, it is an opportunity for you to receive direct advice and guidance regarding your writing style, structure, logic and argumentation and the use of references/secondary material.


**Due to unforeseen circumstances, changes to some aspects of this course (excluding the assessment structure) may be necessary. Any and all changes will be communicated in class. As well, you should thus check carefully the "Course Outline Change Log" below to ensure that you have the most current version. The most current version of the Course Outline can always be found at [www.dtduval.com][24]**.
