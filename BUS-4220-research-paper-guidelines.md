# BUS 4220–002 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS (Winter 2017)

Last update: 5 December 2017 @ 09:54CST

## GUIDELINES AND ADVICE FOR THE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PAPER

### INTRODUCTION

This assessment represents a *significant* piece of independent research and is the single largest component of your final grade in this course. The paper offers you the opportunity to undertake in–depth research (using secondary sources, but perhaps generating new analysis) on a topic of *your choice*. Because of this wide flexibility, early consultation with David (i.e., within the first few weeks of the semester) is *absolutely vital*.

Considerable time will be devoted during class sessions to discussing the broad scope of this assessment. As well, you are more than welcome to schedule an appointment with me during my office hours (see [dtduval.com](http://www.dtduval.com)).

### EXPECTATIONS

1.  The paper *must* address in–depth a specific issue relating to the conduct of international business as discussed in the course.  In other words, your paper must be grounded in the concepts discussed in the course or within the readings.
2.  It is expected to be written and presented with the strongest consideration given to academic scholarship, attention to detail and professional presentation.
3.  Your paper must be *at least* 5000 words in length, and note that this is *exclusive* of any and all references, tables, figures, appendices and notes.
4.  You are expected to use and cite a *minimum* of 25 academic sources, although in practice it is not unusual for students to utilise considerably more.  That said, the absolute number of references is, in itself, not paramount; rather, it is how your references are used that will count toward a higher grade.
5.  Your paper must be submitted electronically as a single typewritten .pdf on the date specified in the Course Outline.  See below on how to submit.

### MARKING GUIDELINES

The following general guidelines shall be used when assigning a grade for this assessment:

1.  **Content (80% of your mark)**

    -   Ability to formulate a relevant and timely problem in the broad
        area of international business.
    -   Demonstrated understanding of critical issues.
    -   Ability to construct argument(s).
    -   Innovative use of material/arguments/references/knowledge.
    -   Demonstration of independent thought.
    -   Ability to undertake specific analysis.
    -   Use of at least 25 academic sources.

2.  **Structure (15% of your mark)**

    -   Logical flow of arguments, sentences, paragraphs.
    -   Appropriate use of sub-headings.

3.  **Style and presentation (5% of your mark)**

    -   Grammar (as indicated above, smaller problems are overlooked).
    -   Spelling (small mistakes are overlooked).
    -   References and citations (relevance, appropriateness, number).

### FORM AND STRUCTURE

1.  Write in the third person.
2.  Write in the present tense.
3.  Do not write an abstract or executive summary — neither is necessary
    for this assessment.
4.  The choice of font, margins and justification is yours. That said, and if you are looking for some suggestions, I would recommend 1.5cm document margins, a nice Serif font such as Times New Roman, and left justification only. You will be evaluated — albeit minimally (see above) — on the “look and feel” of your assessment, so you are advised to make it look “*professional*.
5.  You must include a single title page that contains your name and student number. Please indicate the course code (BUS 4220), your name, my name and the date you submitted.
6.  Do not reference textbooks. This is a research paper in a 4000 level course. You are expected to be utilising materials far more advanced that what most textbooks are able to provide.
7.  For referencing, I will accept any referencing style *as long as it is consistent*.

### HOW TO SUBMIT

Render your final paper as a single .pdf file (not multiple files) and upload via the dropbox facility on Nexus.

### RESOURCES FOR WRITING YOUR RESEARCH PAPER

I spent a bit of time scouring around for what I would consider useful tutorials and resources on how to write a research paper. I say useful because I found quite a bit of stuff that I thought was actually rather terrible.

- The UW library has an [excellent subject guide](http://libguides.uwinnipeg.ca/bus) for business topics that will likely be useful.
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz0YXa9Qwv8) presents a decent overview of the process of writing. Some of it does not quite apply to us in this course because you’re not undertaking experiments and developing theory.
- I quite like [these guidelines](http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/kingch/how_to_write_a_research_paper.htm) from Georgetown University.
- I found a lot of the advice in the initial sections of [this guide from Harvard](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pnikolov/resources/writingtips.pdf) quite useful, but also because I favour the economics style of writing. Don’t worry about the sections on Data and Estimation - they are not relevant for this course.
- Finally, [this is an excellent overview](https://library.wlu.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/tutorials/scholarlysource.pdf) of what constitutes an academic source.
