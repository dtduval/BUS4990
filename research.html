Tourism management (marketing and positioning, political/administrative governance)

TOURISM AND AVIATION: CRITICAL LINKAGES (2009 - 2012)

From 2009 to 2012, whilst based in the School of Business at the University of Otago, I served as Principal Investigator on a competitively-funded project based in New Zealand that sought to explore the complex linkages between tourism and aviation.  Co-investigators for the project included Dr Aaron Schiff of the respected Auckland-based consultancy firm, Covec, as well as Dr Niven Winchester (now at MIT, but formerly in the Department of Economics at the University of Otago).  A 2009 item in the New Zealand Herald profiled the project.

Some outputs from this project have been released publicly and can be found below. Relevant academic articles and publications are listed in my CV.  Specific reports from Covec include the following:

New Zealand Aviation Data Review (22 December 2009)
Capacity on New Zealand Inbound Air Routes (20 January 2010)
Connectivity and Frequency of New Zealand International Air Routes (25 October 2010)
The New Zealand Aviation Operational Environment: A Guide for the Tourism Sector (22 December 2010)
 

PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOHISTORY OF THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN

As part of my Master of Arts in Anthropology (University of Manitoba), Professor Louis Allaire (now retired) and I undertook a survey in 1993 and 1994 of key locations on the island of St Vincent in the Eastern Caribbean. The 1994 field season included some test pits at various sites along the Windward (East) coast. In the interest of disseminating the original results of this research, which would have otherwise been almost impossible to locate, I have made the following freely available:

Duval, David Timothy (1996) Saladoid Archaeology on St. Vincent, West Indies: Results of the 1993/1994 University of Manitoba Survey, MA Thesis (Anthropology), Department of Anthropology, University of Manitoba.
Duval, David Timothy (1994) The 1993 University of Manitoba St. Vincent Site Survey: Preliminary Report Number 1 (Artifact Cataloguing), report presented to the St. Vincent National Trust, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, June 1994.
Allaire, Louis and Duval, David Timothy (1995) 'St. Vincent Revisited', in Alegria, R.E. and Rodriguez, M. (eds) Proceedings of the XV International Congress for Caribbean Archaeology, Centro de Estudios Avasnzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe, con la colaboracion de la Fundacion Puertirquena de las Humanidades y la Univsersidad del Turabo.
Duval, David Timothy (1994) 'Windward Island Migrations: The View from St. Vincent', paper presented at the 26th Annual Conference of the Archaeological Association of the University of Calgary (CHACMOOL).
In addition to numerous academic references over the years, some of this research has been used more recently by various consultants and groups investigating the impact of the new Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent.
