 [Here is the link to the online Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing) where you can volunteer to present a reading to the class.

---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

This page has two functions: (1) it will be used for immediate short-term, day-to-day planning, and (2) a review of what has taken place in each class session.  You can use this to get a sense of what I am planning for each session, based on the materials and rough agenda outlined on the Resources page.  

**Check this page often.  It will be updated frequently.**

As you scroll down, you will find that most dates will have two sections associated with them.  **PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA** will signpost upcoming activities, announcements, deadlines and general miscellaneous items as well as provide a rough outline for that particular day.  The **CLASS NOTES** section is a re-cap of what we actually did that day in class.

## MODULE 1 (Weeks 1 and 2)

## 4 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- We will do roundtable introductions and a review of course objectives.
- Guest speakers this semester: Diane Gray (CentrePort), Mariette Mulaire (WTC Winnipeg), Barry Rempel (WAA), Greg Dandewich (Economic Development Winnipeg)
- Where to go for information:   
    - Check "The Important Stuff" folder on Nexus.
    - The "Readings and Resources" Google Spreadsheet tells you pretty much what and when you need to be reading.  Students registered in the course will be expected to volunteer to present these readings.  If you wish to volunteer, [go to the Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing).  Remember, volunteering/presenting goes toward your contribution grade.
    - The "Daily Notes" page is more or less the course blog, even thought it's a static website that appears [here](http://dtduval.github.io/Daily-Notes/).  You should be checking this page several times a week, if not more often.  It is already long and populated with all kinds of things, but it will get longer.
    - My [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:dtduval) has quite a few links organised by module (e.g., 4220-1 for Module 1), and I will be adding to these as we go along in the course.  
    - [Nexus](http://nexus.uwinnipeg.ca/) also contains a few documents and items specific to each module that I did not (or could not) make public due to copyright issues or logistics.  Nexus is also where I will post your grades (usually as a .pdf with just your student number).  Finally, note that there is a specific section dedicated to the major research paper on Nexus (more later).
- As a further reminder, if everyone uploads a photo of themselves to Nexus, that would be helpful as I can use it to learn your names much more quickly.
- As you will be writing a research paper for this course, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1piETwGKGkrYe4LuPUn97E8xlTqQdZkUAjGMEOd7kv-c/edit?usp=sharing) to go to a public Google Doc spreadsheet where you can indicate your topic area, name and email if you wish to link up with others in the class writing on something similar.  This is a good way to form a study group to share resources, references, etc.
- Reminder: please DO NOT email me through Nexus.  Instead, email me directly on [da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca](mailto:da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca)
- Note that there are four modules in this course.  These are detailed in the course outline.
- To speed up access to the journal article readings for this course, use [this link](http://cufts2.lib.sfu.ca/CRDB/MWUC/resource/6456) to connect to Google Scholar via the UWinnipeg library system.  From there, enter the name of the article and you'll be able to access a .pdf.



**CLASS NOTES**

- Great session today.  Great to meet everyone and see some familiar faces.
- Note that the first presentations will be starting on 11 January.  See the notes for that class below and head to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up to volunteer to present if you are interested.
- Opening Portage and Main is not stupid.  It's a legitimate view, but the point I was trying to make was that I hope the reports they commissioned took into consideration the wider transportation system, including the efficient last-mile movements of goods inside the city.  As we said, it's a critical intersection.  Reducing the flow of traffic through it, whatever the reason, will likely have some impact on traffic flow.
- For next class: I'd like everyone to source a textbook either online on in hard copy (check the library) and bring to class a list of where and how some of the broad topics/news items of today link to the material they have found.
- For next class: I'd like to review the volunteers/reading [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing) and then start some initial discussion questions on the whiteboard.  See the notes and agenda for next class to help you prepare.

---------------------------------------------

## 9 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- Waitlist update
- Recap from the first class and a chance to get clarification on course expectations, plan, assignments, etc.
- We will continue populating the Google spreadsheet with volunteers to start covering some of the readings.  So, if you are interested in any of the upcoming readings (look specifically at Module 1 readings to start with) go to the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing).

- Discussion question: What indicators can we say point to the extent of internationalisation that a company undertakes?
- Discussion question: why do firms become MNEs?


**CLASS NOTES**

- Great class today.  That should give you some idea of how I would like most class sessions to go: an agenda with respect to topics to discuss, but informal and loose enough to accommodate diversions and digressions.  Well done all.
- Apologies for mangling vertical and horizontal FDI.  Need to be more careful when referring to my notes!
- Thanks to those with whom I've already met re: their paper topics.  Good to see you getting a head start.  A gentle reminder to everyone that I really would like to sit down and chat about what topics you are interested in.  Make an appointment to see me via [my website](http://www.dtduval.com).
- I really do need folks to start putting their name beside readings.  Remember, this counts toward your contribution grade in the course.  All I am looking for is a 10-minute oral presentation/synopsis of what the essence of the reading is.  It would be great if you could also think of one or two discussion questions.  
- Don't forget: I'd like everyone to do the readings and be ready to contribute (e.g., offer perspectives, ask questions, answer discussion questions, critique, support, link with other concepts/ideas/courses).


---------------------------------------------

## 11 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- I want to follow-up from last class and introduce Figure 2.2 from the Rugman and Collinson textbook.  It looks at various entry modes (which we spoke about last class, but this does so with a twist, albeit an uncomplicated one).  

- We will start to focus a bit on globalisation today, and some of the readings (journal articles) for this module are directed at this.  It's a massive topic, highly relevant to how business is undertaken internationally, and in some cases very controversial.  Some background online articles can be found in the Pinboard links for this Module (see Nexus).

- Readings to be discussed (in the following order) over the next few classes (volunteers needed to lead):
    - International Economics 1: A brief history of modern economic globalization
    - Fundamentals of Global Strategy 2: The globalization of companies and industries
    - The Global Environment Of Business: New Paradigms For International Management

    - Kandogan, Y. (2014) 'The effect of foreign trade and investment liberalization on spatial concentration of economic activity', International Business Review 23(3):648-659
