I am an Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Business and Economics][1] at the [University of Winnipeg][2] and serve as the Director of the [University of Manitoba Transport Institute][3] at the [Asper School of Business][4].

I also hold appointments as an Honorary Associate Professor in the [School of Business][5] at the [University of Otago][6] (where I was based from 2001 - 2010), a Senior Visiting Fellow in the [School of Aviation][7] at the [University of New South Wales][8] (Australia) and as an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Supply Chain Management in the [I.H. Asper School of Business][4] at the [University of Manitoba][9]. I hold higher degrees from the University of Manitoba and [York University][10].

From 1998 to 2001 I was an analyst and project manager at [Longwoods International][11], a consultancy firm in Toronto specialising in tourism destination marketing, visitor profiling and measuring the efficiency of tourism advertising and promotion. Since then, I have completed consulting assignments with airlines, airports, national/local governments and private-sector firms. In 2006, I was appointed by the [Dunedin City Council][12] (New Zealand) to serve as a Director on the Board of Tourism Dunedin, a position I held until I moved back to Canada in late 2010.

I am quite privileged to serve as the Inaugural Chair of the Transportation Advisory Council within the [Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce][13], which follows on from a few other small projects I've been involved with at the Chamber. I also serve as a member of the Advisory Committee to [CentrePort Canada][14]. For a time, I was a Roster Consultant with the [Business Development Bank of Canada][15], where I enjoyed working with small Winnipeg-based companies in the areas of marketing and general strategy.

In addition to previous advising work for the Government of New Zealand on aviation policy issues, I completed successfully in September 2012 a three-year, NZ$700K research project (funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation and the Tourism Research Group in the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development) that investigated the linkages between tourism and aviation in New Zealand. From 2009 to 2012, I served as the Founder and Director of the Centre for Air Transport Research at the [University of Otago][6].

Academically, my primary area of academic work is the economic regulation of commercial air transport. I have written in the areas of aeropolitics, the economics of international aviation emissions and the relationship between regulation and competition in international civil aviation. Over the years, I have also written about the relationship between international tourism and air transport service provision as well as the interface between government policy objectives and international air transport.

I have had my work published in journals such as the _Journal of Air Law and Commerce_, _Journal of Air Transport Management_, _International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development_, _Current Issues in Tourism_, _Tourism Geographies_ and the _Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing_. In 2007 I wrote [Tourism and Transport: Modes, Networks and Flows][16], and have lately been giving serious thought to writing a second edition. More recently, I co-wrote a book with my colleagues Tim Coles and Gareth Shaw entitled [Student's Guide to Writing Dissertations and Theses in Tourism Studies and Related Disciplines][17] and edited a book with the fine folks at [Ashgate][18] on [Air Transport in the Asia Pacific][19].

At the [University of Winnipeg][20], I enjoy teaching _Introduction to Business _and an advanced course in _International Business_.
